## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

## Lessons Learned

The biggest challenge we faced as a group was figuring out how to stop the game once the player once. werethe images (eels or escalators) appear when the user clicks on each square. 
It was a challenge as a group to write the JavaScript out to ensure this slot machine works properly. One of the biggest issues we encountered was concatenation of our total amount displayed after the user chose to bet either $5 or $50. I enjoyed collaborating on this assignment a lot because multiple brains are better than one.
